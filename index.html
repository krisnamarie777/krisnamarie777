        <h1>Hi, I am Krisna Marie from Bellingham, Washington.</h1>
    
        <p class="lead">I am quirky and wanted to make a website that celebrated my unique voice 
        and journey as a creative and designer.  Every creative's journey is unique, 
        and mine is no exception.   I am relatively new to this journey. This website 
        is a celebration of my curated works and the a journey in  creating, and 
        expressing myself.</p>   
    </header><!--.site-header-->

    <p>As I was developing this website I kept trying to answer endless seemingly 
    complex questions.  Who am I?  Who is my audience?   What is my niche?  Why do 
    I want a website? What benefit will my website have for me and &sol;or for 
    those who view it? Conventional branding &quot;wisdom&quot; says these 
    questions need answers in order to make an interesting, popular, good, 
    effective, and &lbrack;insert adjective&brack; here, website.  
    I kept coming back to the why?  The why I want a website, and I 
    wanted to celebrate the journey of creation.</p>

    <p>While my why was simple, my subject manner&mdash;me, was messy.  So the 
    next question that seemed important to me was how much did I want to share?  
    In realty,  my art, my creations, and myself are not perfect&emdash; this 
    thought is both scary, and freeing. I am feel unbound by the conflicted advice 
    and ready to present my website&emdash;and a sampling of my work.  It, like 
    myself, is a work in progress.</p>
