Right now you just get a blurb I am still working on the website.  If you are curious
about the code you can poke at files but, honestly they are nothing special, yet. 


Hi, I am Krisna Marie from Bellingham, Washington.  I am quirky and wanted to make a website that celebrated my unique voice and journey as a creative and designer.  Every creative's journey is unique, and mine is no exception.   I am relatively new to this journey. This website is a celebration of my curated works and the a journey in  creating, and expressing myself.   

As I was developing this website I kept trying to answer endless seemingly complex questions.  Who am I?  Who is my audience?   What is my niche?  Why do I want a website? What benefit will my website have for me and &sol;or for those who view it? 

Conventional branding &quot;wisdom&quot; says these questions need answers in order to make an interesting, popular, good, effective, and &lbrack;insert adjective&brack; here, website.  I kept coming back to the why?  The why I want a website, and I wanted to celebrate the journey of creation.

While my why was simple, my subject manner&mdesh;me, was messy.  So the next question that seemed important to me was how much did I want to share?  In realty,  my art, my creations, and myself are not perfect&emdash; this thought is both scary, and freeing. I am feel unbound by the conflicted advice and ready to present my website&emdash;and a sampling of my work.  It, like myself, is a work in progress.
